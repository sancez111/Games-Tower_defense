# Letter Defenders 🏰⌨️

A Minecraft-style tower defense learning game for young children (age 5+) to recognize letters and learn their keyboard locations.

## Game Overview

**Letter Defenders** is a web-based (HTML/JS/CSS) tower defense game with three game modes:

### Game Modes
1. **Letter March** — Letters walk down a blocky path toward your base. Type the correct letter to zap them before they arrive.
2. **Keyboard Defense** — Letters light up on a virtual on-screen keyboard. Click/tap the correct key to defend your castle.
3. **Tower Strike** — Enemies carry letters on their shields. Type the letter to fire your tower and destroy them.

### Key Features
- **Minecraft-style pixel/block art** visuals (blocky characters, grid-based world)
- **On-screen keyboard** that highlights where each letter lives (teaches finger placement)
- **Progression system** — starts with a few easy letters (home row), gradually adds more
- **Difficulty scaling** — enemies get faster, more letters appear, shorter reaction times
- **Kid-friendly** — bright colors, fun animations, encouraging feedback

## Tech Stack
- Pure HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (no frameworks)
- HTML5 Canvas for game rendering
- No build step required — just open index.html in a browser
